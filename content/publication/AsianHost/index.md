abstract: we develop a novel approximate computing-based approach to achieve a fast and accurate enough repeated execution for security verification. We implement and evaluate the approximate computing-based security verification framework by conducting a case study on a CPU-FPGA based video motion detection system, in which our experiments on Xilinx Zynq SoC justifies the premium security and low performance overhead obtained by the proposed approach.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

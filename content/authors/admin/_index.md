I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Rutgers University advised by Dr. [Sheng Wei](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~sw891/). I received my bachelor's degree in communications engineering from China University of Petroleum in 2012 and  obtained my master's degree in computer application technology from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015. I started my research work with Dr. Sheng Wei since 2016. 

I have a wide range of research interest spanning from hardware security to multimedia.

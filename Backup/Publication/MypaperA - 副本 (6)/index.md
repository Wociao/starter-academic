# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

360-degree video streaming has been gaining popularities recently with the rapid growth of adopting mobile head mounted display (HMD) devices in the consumer video market, especially for live broadcasts. The 360-degree video streaming introduces brand new bandwidth and latency challenges in live streaming due to the significantly increased video data. However, most of the existing bandwidth saving approaches based on viewport prediction have only focused on the video-on-demand (VOD) use cases leveraging historical user behavior data, which is not available in live broadcasts. We develop a new viewport prediction scheme for live 360-degree video streaming using video content-based motion tracking and dynamic user interest modeling. To obtain real-time performance, we implement the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and optical flow algorithms for motion detection and feature tracking.
